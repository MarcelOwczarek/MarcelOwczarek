- About comits : I don't know why you can't see them in the chart, on the my pc i have other account that published comits in vscode  to current account so maybe that was a reason but i found out that after the fact , pretty weird i now, but overall if you go to repository there is all history of comits :) for now around 100 comits for february/beginnning of march.
